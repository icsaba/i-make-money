# Step 1

let's have a new trading bot, name it SMCTadingBot, that applies smart money concept on 5M or 15M charts mainly and returns a trading plan. If there's nothing to do, do not provide a plan. 

# Step 2

- We should collect candle data for 5M, 15M, 1H, 4H. Cache them appropriatelly to avoid unnecessary calls. 
- Use a queue for possible setups. Check the queue after data collection.
- Use a walletservice to save ongoing trades into a database and manage profit and loss. 
- Check the database after collected data about the candles and manage database records accordingly. 
- Analyze market using SMC and BoS, ChoCH and liquidity grabs.
- Flag A+ setups.


# Step 4

Smart Money Concept (SMC):
Smart Money Concept (SMC) is a trading methodology based on understanding and tracking the behavior of institutional traders or "smart money" - the large financial institutions, banks, hedge funds, and professional traders who move markets with their significant capital.

### Key Components

#### 1. Order Blocks
Areas where institutional traders place large buy or sell orders. These appear as strong candles in one direction followed by a move in the opposite direction.

#### 2. Liquidity
Smart money looks to buy where retail traders place stop losses below support, and sell where retail traders place stop losses above resistance. This is called "liquidity hunting."

#### 3. Market Structure
SMC traders identify shifts in market structure through Higher Highs/Lower Lows (HH/LL) and Higher Lows/Lower Highs (HL/LH) to determine overall trend direction.

#### 4. Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)
Imbalances in price where candles don't overlap, indicating aggressive buying or selling by institutional traders.

#### 5. Change of Character (CHoCH)
A significant shift in market behavior that indicates a potential trend reversal. Key characteristics:
- Occurs after an established trend
- Shows a break in the previous market structure
- Often accompanied by increased volume
- Can be identified by:
  - Bullish CHoCH: A Lower Low (LL) followed by a Higher High (HH)
  - Bearish CHoCH: A Higher High (HH) followed by a Lower Low (LL)
- Confidence increases when:
  - Appears on higher timeframes (4h+)
  - Accompanied by strong volume
  - Aligns with key support/resistance levels

#### 6. Break of Structure (BOS)
A clear violation of the current market structure that signals a potential trend change:
- Bullish BOS:
  - Price breaks above a previous Lower High (LH)
  - Creates a Higher High (HH)
  - Often precedes an uptrend
- Bearish BOS:
  - Price breaks below a previous Higher Low (HL)
  - Creates a Lower Low (LL)
  - Often precedes a downtrend
- Key validation points:
  - Volume confirmation
  - Clean break (no immediate pullback)
  - Higher timeframe alignment

#### 7. Liquidity Grabs
Strategic price movements designed to trigger retail traders' stop losses:
- Characteristics:
  - Quick price spike above resistance or below support
  - Followed by a strong reversal
  - Higher than average volume
  - Often occurs at key psychological levels
- Types:
  - Buy-side liquidity grab:
    - Price sweeps below support
    - Triggers retail stop losses
    - Returns back above support
  - Sell-side liquidity grab:
    - Price sweeps above resistance
    - Triggers retail buy stops
    - Returns back below resistance
- Validation criteria:
  - Volume > 1.5x average
  - Price reversal within the same or next candle
  - Proximity to significant support/resistance levels

#### 8. Breaker Blocks
Former support zones that become resistance or former resistance zones that become support.

#### 9. Imbalances
Areas where price moves rapidly, showing an imbalance between buyers and sellers, often indicative of smart money accumulation or distribution.

### Trading Strategy Implementation

The SMC trading bot implements these concepts with the following priorities:

1. Pattern Priority:
```typescript
const patternPriority = {
  'BOS': 5,      // Highest - confirms trend change
  'ChoCH': 4,    // Strong reversal signal
  'LiquidityGrab': 3, // Important but needs confirmation
  'OrderBlock': 2,    // Support/resistance zones
  'FairValueGap': 1   // Lowest priority
};
```

2. Timeframe Priority:
```typescript
const timeframePriority = {
  '4h': 4,  // Higher timeframe more significant
  '1h': 3,
  '15m': 2,
  '5m': 1   // Lower timeframe less significant
};
```

3. Entry Rules:
- Pattern must be high confidence (> 0.7)
- Current price within 0.25% of entry level
- Pattern must align with market structure
- Multiple pattern confluence increases probability
- Risk-reward ratio must exceed 1.5

4. Risk Management:
- Stop loss based on nearest swing level
- Position sizing based on account risk
- Multiple take-profit levels
- Pattern invalidation rules

In practical application, the bot analyzes multiple timeframes simultaneously, starting with higher timeframes (4H, 1H) to establish market context, then drilling down to lower timeframes (15m, 5m) for precise entry timing. This multi-timeframe approach helps ensure that trades are taken in the direction of the overall trend while maximizing the probability of success.
